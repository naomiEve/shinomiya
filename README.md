A lightweight, minimalistic and responsive personal website template, which powers my personal website over at https://nanoshinono.me/

I've decided to release it, since this is probably the first design that in my opinion didn't look horrible.

Everything that you'd want to modify is inside `index.html`, including the links, heading, name and meta tags.
